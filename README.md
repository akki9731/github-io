### GithubIO: Github Issue Opener

I have created this script to help me open issues automatically in appropriate repositories after reading the details from a so called `PM Issue`.

The supported syntax for the `PM Issue` is like this
```
 - [ ] **1** Task 1 title. Task 1 Description
 - [ ] **2** Task 2 title. Task 2 Description
 - [ ] **3** Task 3 title. Task 3 Description
 ...
```
